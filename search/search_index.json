This article covers how to install Mindustry on different platforms and situations. Typical Setup This is your typical, run-of-the-mill setup process. Desktop Steam As of recent, you can now buy the game on Steam if you would like to support Anuke! Itch.io Visit the game's itch.io page , then download a copy of the game from there. Once the .zip file is downloaded, unzip it. Usually that is just done by opening it like normal. When it's done, navigate to the folder it extracted into. Windows : simply open desktop-release.exe . MacOS : run Mindustry.app. Linux : run Mindustry . If you have JRE already installed (which is recommended), you can also run desktop-release.jar on Windows and Linux. Android Play Store There are two different versions of Mindustry on the Play Store; Mindsutry and Mindustry Classic. If you want to get the latest releases of Mindustry, go get Mindustry . Otherwise, if you want the old classic version, you can get Mindustry Classic . F-Droid F-Droid is an open source app repository that makes sure all apps are secure and not tampered with. First, you will have to download the F-Droid app here. After it has installed, you can install Mindustry from there. Notice: You will usually get the latest updates through the Play Store before F-Droid. iOS The latest released builds are available on iOS devices only for purchase. For Contributors If you would like to contribute to the game's source code, the best way to go is to compile the game yourself. To compile it yourself: If you haven't already, install at least JRE and JDK 8. Open a terminal in the root directory, then run these commands: For Windows: Running: gradlew desktop:run Building: gradlew desktop:dist For Linux: Running: ./gradlew desktop:run Building: ./gradlew desktop:dist For Server builds, replace desktop with server . Example: ./gradlew server:run","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"GettingStarted/#getting-started","text":"Getting started with Mindustry is easy.

Cost [Items] Cost is how much time an item adds to the time it takes to build a block that uses it. One cost = one tick added to build time. For example, the Battery requires 8CP , 30LE , and 4SI . The build time is processed like this: (0.6 * 8) + (0.9 * 30) + (0.9 * 8) = 39 Therefore, it takes 39 ticks to build a Battery by yourself. Hardness [Items] The time it takes to mine one item is partially dependent on the hardness of an item. Sand is the least hardest, while Thorium is the hardest. [needs correction] For example, mining Copper with your Mining Laser gets you copper much faster than when mining Thorium. That is because Thorium is harder than Copper. Radioactivity [Items] Radioactivity is the potency of the material in nuclear-based blocks like the RTG. In said block, Thorium generates more electricity than Phase because it is much more radioactive. Flammability [Items, Liquids] As it suggests, it is the measure of flammability of an item or liquid. It is also the speed at which it burns and the speed at which it spreads across blocks that are made of it, and enemies which are hit by it as a projectile. For example, Plastanium burns slower than coal , which burns much slower than Pyratite . Furthermore, when Pyratite is used as ammo, it will burn enemies faster and stronger than Blast Compound . When Lava is used as an ammo in the Wave, it will burn enemies unlike Cryofluid or Oil . Tip: Make sure distribution blocks (Conveyors, Vaults, Bridges) that contain flammable or explosive materials are protected and kept away from potential damage, like a Reactor or enemy path. For example, if a Reactor explodes near a conveyor with Coal, the majority of the conveyor will immediately explode because of the Coal on it. Explosiveness [Items, Liquids] As it suggests, it is the measure of explosiveness of an item or liquid. That is most useful in an ammunition application, where the most explosive item (not liquid) will deal the largest damage over the largest area. Blast Compound is the most explosive item as its name, \"Blast\", suggests. Oil is the most and only explosive liquid. If shot from a Wave and set on fire using Pyratite or Lava, it will burn and explode enemies that are around it. The same thing goes for Liquid Tanks and the such that are filled with it. Tip: Keep explosive material protected and separate from your Core or any exposed lines, unless it is needed. It is highly explosive and when triggered, will deal damage to surrounding blocks as well. Read the previous tip, too. Fluxiness [Items] Fluxiness is the measure of the ability of an item to be used as flux. Flux is essentially a 'filler' system, substituting the regular resources with masses of cheaper ones. For example, a Smelter will accept Sand, Phase Fabric, and Biomatter as flux, and thus use less of its regular ingredients. The same goes for the Arc Smelter and Alloy Smelter. Tip: In many maps, Sand is an extremely abundant material, so a line saturated with Sand combined with a Vault or Container system that distributes it widely is good practice if you have tons of production. Heat Capacity [Liquids] Heat capacity is the measure of the effectiveness of a liquid in absorbing and dissipating heat. The higher the Heat Cap., the faster it will cool things like the Thorium Reactor down. Temperature [Liquids] The temperature of a liquid. Viscosity [Liquids] Viscosity determines the speed at which a liquid flows. A higher viscosity means it flows slower, while a lower one means it flows much faster. Status Effect [Liquids] The status effect of the liquid is passed on to an entity that is hit by it or is standing on it. Melting Lava has the \"melting\" status effect, which means that enemies that are hit by it (from a Wave) or are standing on a puddle of it will start burning and melting. Tarred With the \"tarred\" status effect, enemies will move slower and be more susceptible to fire. Freezing Enemies will move extremely slow as they freeze. This is useful for slowing down swift air enemies to make them easier to shoot.","title":"Characteristics"},{"location":"characteristics/#characteristics","text":"NOTICE: A lot of the content on this page is not up-to-date and refers to an older version of the game.","title":"Characteristics"},{"location":"characteristics/#cost-items","text":"Cost is how much time an item adds to the time it takes to build a block that uses it.

Make sure you look at this repository for an example of a simple mod. It may be simpler to download this example and edit it. Take your pick. Creating Your First Mod First, create a folder for your mod. The name is irrelevant. Then, create a mod.json file that will contain the metadata for your mod. It should look like this: { \"name\": \"Mod Name\", \"author\": \"your name\", \"description\": \"the mod's description\", \"version\": \"1.0\" } This defines what the mod will look like in the 'Mods' menu after it is imported. Importing Your Mods There are two ways to import a mod: 1) Copy-paste the mod's folder into Mindustry's mod folder. On Steam, this is located in Mindustry's Steam installation directory: steam/steamapps/common/Mindustry/mods . On other desktop versions, this is located in %appdata%/Mindustry/mods . 2) Zip up the contents of the mod folder ( not the folder itself - only its contents) and import it through the file chooser in Main Menu -> Mods -> Import Mod . If a mod is already zipped up, skip the first step. This is not recommended for mod development, as you will have to re-import the mod every time you change something. Creating Content, Folder Structure In general, content is defined through json files located in a few special folders. The exact format of these files depends on the type of content you're making, but in general, the structure is: <mod root folder> - the root folder for your mod bundles/ - the folder where the names and strings for your blocks are stored bundle.properties - the bundle for a specific language; bundle.properties would be the default (english) <bundles for other languages, like bundle_ru.properties> content - where content files is defined, e.g. units, zones, blocks, items blocks/ - all blocks must go here someblock1.json - defines a block named 'someblock1' items/ - all items must go here someitem.json - defines an item named 'someitem' <any other content folders, e.g. for units> sprites/ - all sprites for the blocks and items you add must go here blocks/ - technically, it's not required to put your sprites in separate folders, but it's good practice crafting/ - sprites for someblock1, etc someblock1.png someblock2.png environment/ - sprites for environmental floors and ores somefloor1.png someore1.png items/ - sprites for items and liquids someitem.png someliquid.png <any other sprites you use>/ See the example to see what this hierarchy like in a real mod. Creating a new block Each type of block needs a few base properties: - Its type . This can range from things like ItemTurret to Floor to Wall . Each type of block had a different set of configuration options. A full, descriptive list of block types will be available soon. - A name and description . While these are technically optional, they are highly recommended. An example of these properties: { \"type\": \"Wall\", \"name\": \"White Wall\", \"description\": \"A completely blank wall.

There are two main types of servers; dedicated servers and local LAN servers. Dedicated Servers Dedicated servers are standalone, headless versions of the game that are focused only on providing a means for people to play Multiplayer. They are usually run on a computer as a separate program rather than in-game, and are operated from the terminal. These are usually stronger than a local LAN server as they have more resources available to them to support more than two or three players, and can be run 24/7. They are also more versatile and powerful in that they have many commands to provide the administrator with more control over it, and they can easily be modded to fit the administrator's needs. You can connect to one using the \"Join Game\" button under the \"Play\" menu. Unlike local LAN servers, you will have to enter the host's IP address and port. Also unlike local LAN servers, once you add a server, it will automatically show up on your server list when you open it, and the game will automatically check the server's status. To establish a dedicated server, a dedicated Linux or Windows machine is highly recommended. If you haven't already, install at least JRE and JDK 8. Download the desired server release from itch.io , or compile one yourself. Open a terminal or TTY session then change cd to the directory the JAR is placed in. Run java -jar server.jar using Command Prompt (on Windows) or your favorite terminal (on Linux and Mac). The commands are explained in the help command. If you are using Windows to run your server, use your favorite search engine to look up how to add rules to your Windows Firewall, as it blocks that port most of the time. Make sure to allow port 6567 TCP and UDP . If you want your server to be publicly available around the world, then read the following. If not, then you are done! Before starting though, be sure that you have permission to your router's admin settings. Most importantly, never share your public IP with the public, unless you acknowledge the implications of doing so! Your public IP is tied to your household, and if it falls into the wrong hands, it can be used to easily find your approximate location, even down to the city or block you live in. There is more that can happen; such as DoS attacks, data and information exploitation and collection, and unwanted access to other open ports in your network. Exercise caution, do your research, and use a VPN if possible. If you would like to host a public server for public use, it is recommended that you use a domain name or DNS service to mask your IP a little bit, or use a cloud service e.g. Amazon AWS which is much safer. Again do your research . Find the make/model of your router. This is usually on a sticker on the bottom or back of the router. Use your favorite search engine to search 'port forward [your router make/model/name here]' and use the guide to foward port 6567 TCP and UDP . These instructions are different for every router, so be sure to read your guide thoroughly! You can use a service such as You Get Signal to check if you have done your portforwarding correctly. Local LAN Servers A local LAN server is a server that is built into the game, and can be started using the \"Host Multiplayer Game\" button in the in-game menu. It is meant to be simple and straightforward, for sessions between a few players under a LAN network (aka in your household's WiFi network). It is not really meant for several players, as it takes more and more resources from your device to be able to use it that way; for that you will need a dedicated server mentioned above. It can only run when the game is open, and is immediately terminated when it is closed. You can connect to one using the \"Join Game\" button under the \"Play\" menu.

The goal of the game is to not die! You die when your core reaches 0 health. This is your core: Start by getting ore. Copper should be priority #1, for you only need copper to build the first drill tier and conveyors. Mine with your Mech (see this ) Mine with a drill (you start with 0 copper, so you will need to get 45 copper to get your first drill + conveyors) Let your spirit drone mine Copper for you (see Spirit Drone on this page) Once you have a good Copper income, you can mine Lead. Lead can be mined with the tier 1 drill as well. After lead, Dense Alloy should be produced. Please see Advanced Concepts for the materials processing of Dense Alloy, Silicone, Titanium, Thorium, Plastanium, Phase Fabric, and Surge Alloy. Input / Output Basics Here are a few basics / tips to understanding block input/output behaviors. 1. Conveyors moving away from a production block will be output. This drill will mine and put ore on all conveyors that take the ore away from the drill. In this example, the drill will put Lead on all 7 conveyors, but not the eight one because that conveyor moves towards the drill. The drill will prioritize each path evenly. If a path is blocked, it is not considered as an output. Notice that a conveyor moving into the Core deposits the material into the core inventory. Once a material is in the Core inventory, you can use it to build immediately, regardless of location. 2. Conveyors moving towards a block will be an input for the block (only if applicable). In this example, a Smelter is turning 2 Lead , 1 Copper , and 1 Coal into 1 Dense Alloy . The Smelter is smart enough to know that the belts moving towards the Smelter are inputs and the one conveyor moving away is the output. A block that takes materials as inputs will not accept any materials that it cannot utilize. Here is a quick summary of inputs and outputs. A GREEN arrow is an input. A RED arrow is a possible output. Any conveyor facing towards the block will be considered an input. Any conveyor facing away from the block is considered an output. This doesn't make much sense for a drill, since drills cannot take any solid item inputs. But this will apply for other crafting blocks which will be covered later. (This concept also applies for liquids, also covered later) 3. Blocks that output can directly place into other blocks. This last example is a Pneumatic Drill mining stone and using a Pulverizer to turn it into sand. A pulverizer turns stone into sand by using power. Notice the drill does not use any conveyors; the stone goes directly into the pulverizer . Please note that touching blocks are considered outputs and will be the same output priority as a conveyor or other blocks. Mech Mining If you do not start near copper patches, it might be difficult to begin your game. Having copper income is the very first thing you need to set up, because all drills and conveyors use copper. To mine, tap on a single ore square. The mech will start mining with a laser. You will see ore flying out of the patch. If a mine (any ore square) is close enough to your core, the items will automatically fly right to the core. If a mine is not close enough, the mined ore will fly onto your mech. There is not a good way to determine how much ore your mech is carrying, but your mech will stop mining once it is full. You will also notice that your mech is much slower than before. You can only hold one type of material at a time. To drop off the mined ore or current mech inventory, on mobile, tap and hold on a spot near your mech. On desktop, drag from your mech to the recipient. A small icon (a circle with the ore icon) will appear. The recipient block will display its outline if it can accept the item. Drag this over the core to deposit it in the core inventory. Drag it into any block which accepts the item to drop it off in the block. Drag it to an empty space to discard it. You can pick things off of a conveyor. Click on the conveyor. The conveyor contents will show up. Tap/click on the icon to pick it off the belt and add it to your mech's inventory. This is very useful when there is one item blocking the path due to a contamination or error. You can also take items out of any block that accepts or produces items. In the above example, the Smelter cannot produce Dense Alloy because it lacks Copper. Why? Because the conveyor has 1 Titanium, which the Smelter cannot accept, thus, it backs up the rest of the conveyor. Spirit Drone A single spirit drone will spawn for you. This and other drones will mine, help build, and repair blocks. If the spirit drone originating from your core dies, a new one will spawn from the core shortly. You cannot control what drones do. The drones' priorities go as follows: Mine Ores > Assist in building > Repair blocks While building, drones will stop assisting and quickly mine ores that are running out. Tips and Tricks You can confirm a block, cancel the build (this will stop your mech from building, but the confirmed build will remain) and continue this one block a time to set up a large queue. This can be helpful when you want to get something started, but need to address something else first. Drones will not work on these queues, so this is only a placeholder. Containers making contact with your Core will act like extra inventory for your Core. This not only gives more inventory space, but allows for more space to input raw materials, as well as output raw materials from your inventory (See Unloader) An Unloader will take materials out of both the Core or connected Containers because they now share the same inventory space.","title":"Basics"},{"location":"Beginner Tutorials/Basics/#basics","text":"NOTICE: A lot of the content on this page is not up-to-date and refers to an older version of the game. The goal of the game is to not die! You die when your core reaches 0 health. This is your core: Start by getting ore. Copper should be priority #1, for you only need copper to build the first drill tier and conveyors. Mine with your Mech (see this ) Mine with a drill (you start with 0 copper, so you will need to get 45 copper to get your first drill + conveyors) Let your spirit drone mine Copper for you (see Spirit Drone on this page) Once you have a good Copper income, you can mine Lead. Lead can be mined with the tier 1 drill as well. After lead, Dense Alloy should be produced. Please see Advanced Concepts for the materials processing of Dense Alloy, Silicone, Titanium, Thorium, Plastanium, Phase Fabric, and Surge Alloy.","title":"Basics"},{"location":"Beginner Tutorials/Basics/#input-output-basics","text":"Here are a few basics / tips to understanding block input/output behaviors. 1. Conveyors moving away from a production block will be output. This drill will mine and put ore on all conveyors that take the ore away from the drill. In this example, the drill will put Lead on all 7 conveyors, but not the eight one because that conveyor moves towards the drill. The drill will prioritize each path evenly. If a path is blocked, it is not considered as an output. Notice that a conveyor moving into the Core deposits the material into the core inventory. Once a material is in the Core inventory, you can use it to build immediately, regardless of location. 2. Conveyors moving towards a block will be an input for the block (only if applicable). In this example, a Smelter is turning 2 Lead , 1 Copper , and 1 Coal into 1 Dense Alloy . The Smelter is smart enough to know that the belts moving towards the Smelter are inputs and the one conveyor moving away is the output. A block that takes materials as inputs will not accept any materials that it cannot utilize.","title":"Input / Output Basics"},{"location":"Beginner Tutorials/Basics/#here-is-a-quick-summary-of-inputs-and-outputs","text":"A GREEN arrow is an input. A RED arrow is a possible output. Any conveyor facing towards the block will be considered an input. Any conveyor facing away from the block is considered an output. This doesn't make much sense for a drill, since drills cannot take any solid item inputs. But this will apply for other crafting blocks which will be covered later. (This concept also applies for liquids, also covered later) 3. Blocks that output can directly place into other blocks. This last example is a Pneumatic Drill mining stone and using a Pulverizer to turn it into sand. A pulverizer turns stone into sand by using power. Notice the drill does not use any conveyors; the stone goes directly into the pulverizer . Please note that touching blocks are considered outputs and will be the same output priority as a conveyor or other blocks.","title":"Here is a quick summary of inputs and outputs."},{"location":"Beginner Tutorials/Basics/#mech-mining","text":"If you do not start near copper patches, it might be difficult to begin your game. Having copper income is the very first thing you need to set up, because all drills and conveyors use copper. To mine, tap on a single ore square. The mech will start mining with a laser. You will see ore flying out of the patch. If a mine (any ore square) is close enough to your core, the items will automatically fly right to the core. If a mine is not close enough, the mined ore will fly onto your mech. There is not a good way to determine how much ore your mech is carrying, but your mech will stop mining once it is full. You will also notice that your mech is much slower than before. You can only hold one type of material at a time.
